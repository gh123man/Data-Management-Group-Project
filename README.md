DBZ Database project
--------------------

##General Stuff
 - Community version of IntelliJ IDEA is here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition
 - Make sure you have jdk 1.8 set up. I am compiling with the orical jdk. Openjdk should also work fine
 - Please ensure you are using 4 spaces instead of '/t' (tabs). [See here on how to change it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8534819/how-can-i-use-tabs-for-indentation-in-intellij-idea)


##How to push
 - For now lets all push to master. If this gets ugly we will start using branches. 
 
 
###1.Set your remote (using ssh)
    git remote add origin git@github.com:gh123man/Data-Managment-Group-Project.git

###2. Pushing for the first time
    git push -u origin master

###3. Pushing after that
    git push
